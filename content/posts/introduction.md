<script>
    document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
        renderMathInElement(document.body, {
            delimiters: [
                {left: "$$", right: "$$", display: true},
                {left: "$", right: "$", display: false}
            ]
        });
    });
</script>


This post is just a test introduction to see if this site is working and what I can do on it immediately. 

On this site I will post study notes, therefore it must have mathematical rendering enabled. 

Such as, 
$$
e^{i\pi} = -1
$$
Which is actually a special of the more general expression 
$$
i\sin(\theta) + \cos(\theta) = e^{i\theta}
$$

# Honours Thesis 

This short post contains links to my honours thesis and honours presentation.  
The topic of my thesis was to create a computational structure for a
semi-parametric vector generalized linear model. This was based on the earlier work of my supervisor, who had built up the theoretical framework for this model
over a series of papers with other collaborators.

# Poisson Distribution 


The general form of the pdf for the Poisson distribution is 

$$
f(x; \lambda)  = \mathbb{P}(X = x)  = \frac{\lambda^x e^{-\lambda}}{x!}
$$

And in this instance we say that the R.V \\(X \sim P(\lambda)\\). 

# PGF

The Probability Generating function of a Poisson Distribution has the following form  

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{G}\_{X} &= \sum_{k = 0}^{\infty} \\\\ 
                 &= \sum_{k = 0}^{\infty} 
\end{aligned}
$$
